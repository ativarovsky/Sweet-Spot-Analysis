- Epic ID: Z followed by numeric natural key
	- in DWH, MRN is used (patient primary MRN)
- Patient SID: DWH master data assigned, shouldn't change for an individual
- MEMB_MPI_NO = unique EZ cap ID for a patient, regardless of plan (EZ cap version of Patient SID) 
	- "natural key"
	- some exceptions but for the most part, we don't expect this to change for an individual
	- 36 character (GUID) 
	- example: E3F28D3B-7F73-4DAE-A420-09DC5A74DAE3
- MEMB_KEYID: when a member is assigned to a health plan, they get this number
	- this should change if a patient changes plans within a company
- Company ID: separation of regional data 
	- EZ Cap has a database for each company, ALTAMED = LA county, ALTAOC = Orange county, ALTACHLA, SBC = 
	Senior buena care (PACE)
	- not dependent on plan or line of business
	- ALTANET: if a patient is RKK (or full risk), they will have an entry with AltaNet and an entry with ALTAMED
	ALTAOC, ALTACHLA
	- sometimes a patient is ALTANET only, these patients should mostly be excluded from analysis, they are 
	part of claims processing (ask Norman Decker) 
- MembID = Health plan assigned
	- example: 848A2298070
	- changes if health plan changes
	- CIN = MediCal ID


Patient SID: DWH master data assigned

Memb MPI NO: EZ Cap number, shouldn't change, sometimes does

- DWH houses natural key for two systems: MRN crosswalsk to Memb MPI number

- Dim All Patient: use current record = Y

// Mtg with Phil
- Mrn is one to one match Patient Epic ID
	- MRN is what users see, but Clarity tables are Patient Epic ID based
- EZ Cap side is more complicated
	- Memb Key ID = system identifier, plan based, insruance cards
	- one person has one MPI number, in theory
	- Member ID = user facing ID on insurance card, if you switch 

- what to roll up to: in EZCap we only roll up to specific 

- patient SID could have two EZ Cap MPI numbers, or five Epir MRNs 
	- Dim All Patient has source system records that still exist (make sure that 
	- IPA patients don't have Epic record 

Counting costs: paid per insurance card
